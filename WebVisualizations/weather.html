    <h2>Summary: Latitude vs. X </h2>
    <p> The purpose of this project is to analyze weather changes as you get closer to the equator.
        To accomplish this analyis, we first pulled data from OpenWeatherMap API to assemble a
        dataset on over 500 cities.
        <br><br>After aseembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects
        of the weather vs. latitude. 
        Factors we looked at included:temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and
        visualziations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and desscriptions of any
        trends and correlations observeed.
